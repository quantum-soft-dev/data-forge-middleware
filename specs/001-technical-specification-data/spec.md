- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06
- Q: When a partial file upload fails mid-transfer (network interruption), how should the system handle file integrity and retry behavior? ‚Üí A: Discard partial upload completely; client must restart from beginning with same filename allowed
- Q: When an account is deactivated with active (IN_PROGRESS) batches, what should happen to those batches and their uploaded files? ‚Üí A: Allow active batches to complete naturally; prevent new batch creation only
- Q: What is the acceptable API response time target (95th percentile) for non-upload operations (authentication, batch operations, queries)? ‚Üí A: < 1000ms (standard web application)
- Q: When storage (S3) operations fail during file upload, should the system retry automatically or fail immediately and rely on the client to retry? ‚Üí A: Retry automatically with fixed interval (3 attempts); then fail
- Q: Should the system enforce data retention policies or keep uploaded files and error logs indefinitely? ‚Üí A: Keep indefinitely; manual deletion only (via admin operations)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Client applications (Windows services) running at remote locations need to regularly export data files and upload them to a central storage system. Each client represents a physical site (store, branch, warehouse) that collects data throughout the day. The system must provide secure authentication, track upload batches, handle errors gracefully, and provide administrators with visibility into all operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Client Authentication and Token Acquisition
1. **Given** a registered site with valid domain and secret credentials, **When** the client requests authentication, **Then** the system issues a time-limited token for subsequent operations
2. **Given** an inactive site attempts authentication, **When** credentials are provided, **Then** authentication is denied with appropriate error message
3. **Given** invalid credentials are provided, **When** authentication is attempted, **Then** the system rejects access

#### Scenario 2: Batch Upload Lifecycle
1. **Given** an authenticated client needs to upload files, **When** a new batch is started, **Then** the system creates a unique batch identifier and dedicated storage location
2. **Given** a site already has an active batch that hasn't expired, **When** attempting to start a new batch, **Then** the system prevents duplicate active batches
3. **Given** a site has an expired active batch, **When** starting a new batch, **Then** the system automatically marks the previous batch as incomplete and creates a new one
4. **Given** files are uploaded to an active batch, **When** all uploads complete successfully, **Then** the client can mark the batch as completed
5. **Given** a critical error occurs during processing, **When** the client reports the failure, **Then** the batch is marked as failed with error details

#### Scenario 3: File Upload Operations
1. **Given** an active batch exists, **When** one or more compressed CSV files are uploaded, **Then** files are stored with metadata tracking and checksum verification
2. **Given** a file with duplicate name is uploaded to the same batch, **When** the upload is attempted, **Then** the system rejects the duplicate
3. **Given** a file exceeds the maximum size limit, **When** upload is attempted, **Then** the system rejects the oversized file
4. **Given** the batch file limit is reached, **When** additional files are uploaded, **Then** the system prevents exceeding the limit

#### Scenario 4: Error Logging and Tracking
1. **Given** a client encounters an error during file processing, **When** error details are submitted, **Then** the system records the error with full context and metadata
2. **Given** errors occur within a specific batch, **When** logged, **Then** the batch is flagged with error indicators
3. **Given** errors occur outside batch context, **When** submitted, **Then** the system logs them independently for later analysis

#### Scenario 5: Administrative Operations
1. **Given** an administrator needs to manage accounts, **When** creating a new account, **Then** the system establishes a unique account with email validation
2. **Given** an account exists, **When** creating sites for that account, **Then** each site receives unique credentials and domain identification
3. **Given** an administrator needs visibility, **When** querying batch history, **Then** the system provides filterable lists with status, file counts, and error indicators
4. **Given** errors need investigation, **When** administrators query error logs, **Then** the system provides searchable, filterable error records with export capabilities
5. **Given** an account must be deactivated, **When** soft delete is performed, **Then** the account and all associated sites are marked inactive

#### Scenario 6: Automatic Batch Timeout Handling
1. **Given** a batch has been in progress beyond the timeout period, **When** the scheduled cleanup task runs, **Then** expired batches are automatically marked as incomplete

### Edge Cases
- What happens when network interruption occurs during file upload?
  - System discards any partial upload data completely; client may retry upload with same filename (no duplicate prevention applies to failed uploads)
- What happens when a client tries to upload to a completed batch?
  - System must reject uploads to completed, failed, or cancelled batches
- What happens when the account reaches the maximum number of active batches?
  - System must prevent creation of additional batches until existing ones complete
- What happens when authentication token expires during a long upload session?
  - Client must be able to renew token without disrupting ongoing operations
- What happens when identical files are uploaded in different batches?
  - Files in different batches are independent; only same-batch duplicates are prevented
- What happens when S3 storage becomes unavailable?
  - System automatically retries storage operations with fixed interval (3 attempts total); returns error to client if all attempts fail
- What happens when querying partitioned error logs across multiple months?
  - System must efficiently query across partitions for date range searches
- What happens when an account is deactivated with active batches?
  - Active batches continue processing and may complete naturally; account deactivation prevents creation of new batches only

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Account**: Represents a user of the system who can manage multiple data sources. Contains email (unique identifier for access), name, activity status, and temporal tracking. One account can oversee multiple sites but must have a unique email across the entire system.

- **Site (Data Source)**: Represents a physical or logical data source (branch, store, warehouse, system) from which files originate. Each site belongs to exactly one account and has a unique domain identifier used in authentication and storage organization. Contains automatically generated authentication credentials, human-readable display name, and independent activity status.

- **Batch (Upload Session)**: Represents a single file upload session initiated by a client service. Tracks the lifecycle of a group of related files uploaded together with status progression (in-progress ‚Üí completed/failed/cancelled/not-completed). Contains storage path reference, file count metrics, size totals, error indicators, timing information, and maintains constraint that only one active batch exists per site at a time.

- **UploadedFile**: Represents metadata for a single uploaded file within a batch. Contains original file name, storage location reference, size, content type, integrity checksum, and upload timestamp. Prevents duplicate file names within the same batch and enforces size and count limits.

- **ErrorLog**: Represents an error event reported by a client application, either associated with a specific batch or standalone. Contains error classification (type, title), detailed messages, stack traces, client version information, and flexible metadata in structured format. Uses time-based partitioning for efficient storage and querying of historical data.
