# Specification Quality Checklist: Security System Separation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Clarifications Resolved** (2025-10-10):

1. **FR-007**: Migration strategy → **RESOLVED**: Migrate to JWT-only under `/api/dfc/**` and deprecate `/api/v1/**` GET endpoints
2. **FR-010**: Backward compatibility → **RESOLVED**: Breaking change - all clients must update immediately (no migration period)

All clarifications have been integrated into the specification. The feature is ready for planning with `/speckit.plan`.
