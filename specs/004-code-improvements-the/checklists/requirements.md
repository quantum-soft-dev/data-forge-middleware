- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: The specification focuses on DTO structures, error handling patterns, and API contracts without mentioning specific Java classes, Spring annotations, or implementation approaches.

✅ **Focused on user value**: Each user story clearly articulates the business value - type safety, API reliability, consistent error handling, and improved documentation.

✅ **Written for non-technical stakeholders**: The specification uses business language (admin users, API consumers, developers) and avoids technical jargon where possible. Implementation details are only mentioned where necessary to define the contract.

✅ **All mandatory sections completed**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, and Success Criteria are all fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**: The specification makes informed decisions about all aspects of the feature based on existing codebase patterns.

✅ **Requirements are testable and unambiguous**: Each FR specifies exact DTO names, fields, and behaviors. For example, FR-006 specifies "AccountWithStatsResponseDto: all account fields + sitesCount, totalBatches, totalUploadedFiles".

✅ **Success criteria are measurable**: All SCs include specific metrics (zero Map<String, Object> parameters, 100% test pass rate, zero "object" types in documentation).

✅ **Success criteria are technology-agnostic**: While DTO names are mentioned (which are part of the API contract), the success criteria focus on observable outcomes like "zero Map<String, Object> parameters remain" rather than implementation details.

✅ **All acceptance scenarios are defined**: 4 user stories with 23 total acceptance scenarios covering all major flows.

✅ **Edge cases are identified**: 6 edge cases documented covering validation failures, type errors, exception handling, and nested structures.

✅ **Scope is clearly bounded**: The feature focuses specifically on admin controllers (AccountAdminController, SiteAdminController, ErrorAdminController, BatchAdminController) and ErrorLogController. It excludes other controllers (BatchController, FileUploadController, AuthController) which already use DTOs or don't need changes.

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions identified**: 10 assumptions documented covering existing infrastructure (ErrorResponseDto, PageResponseDto, validation annotations, OpenAPI configuration).

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps to one or more acceptance scenarios in the user stories.

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: The 4 user stories are prioritized and cover the complete refactoring journey from input DTOs (P1) through output DTOs (P2) to error handling (P3) and documentation (P4).

✅ **Feature meets measurable outcomes**: The 8 success criteria provide clear pass/fail conditions for feature completion.

✅ **No implementation details leak into specification**: While DTO names and field lists are mentioned, these are part of the API contract (visible to consumers) rather than implementation details. The specification does not prescribe how DTOs are implemented, how validation works internally, or how the global exception handler is structured.

## Notes

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

This specification is complete and ready for the `/speckit.plan` phase. All checklist items pass validation. The feature scope is well-defined, requirements are testable, and success criteria are measurable.

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization of user stories enables incremental development
- Comprehensive edge case coverage reduces risk of surprises during implementation
- Detailed DTO field specifications enable straightforward implementation
- Success criteria provide unambiguous completion conditions

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
- Break down user stories into granular tasks by controller
- Consider test-first approach given the "100% test pass" requirement
- Plan for batch testing after each controller refactoring to catch integration issues early
