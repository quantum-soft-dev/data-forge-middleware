## Architecture

### DDD (Package by Layered Feature)
- **Layers per domain**: `domain/` (aggregate, value objects, repository interface, events) → `application/` (services, schedulers) → `infrastructure/` (`Jpa*` repo impl, S3) → `presentation/` (controllers + `dto/`)
- **Aggregates**: Account, Site, Batch, ErrorLog, Plugin, Comparison, DeviceAuthorization, AppSetting
- **Value Objects**: JwtToken, FileChecksum, SiteCredentials, BatchStatus, SiteType, TableSchema
- **Events**: AccountDeactivatedEvent, BatchStartedEvent, PluginActivatedEvent
- **Repository Pattern**: Interface in domain, JPA in infrastructure

### Authentication
- **Device API** (`/api/v1/device/**`): OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Flow with access + refresh tokens. It provides authorization and surviving metadata/read operations; ingestion uses Delta gRPC.
- **Retired client API** (`/api/dfc/**`): no controllers or authentication chain remain; requests are denied.
- **Admin API** (`/api/v1/**`): Auth0 OAuth2 (ROLE_ADMIN/ROLE_USER)
- **Plugin API** (`/api/v1/plugins/bit-bi/**`): API key via `X-Plugin-Api-Key` header; per-account rate limiting (Bucket4j token bucket)

### User Types
1. **Admin Users** (ROLE_ADMIN): Pure Auth0 users, NO PostgreSQL Account record
2. **Regular Users** (ROLE_USER): Auth0 + PostgreSQL Account (bidirectional via `identity_provider_user_id`)

### Database Patterns
- **Partitioning**: error_logs, plugin_audit_logs (monthly range)
- **Soft Delete**: isActive flag on accounts/sites
- **N+1 Prevention**: JOIN FETCH in @Query annotations
- **Cursor Pagination**: For large datasets (batches, audit logs)
- **JSONB**: site_schemas, plugin metadata, comparison diffs (Hypersistence Utils)
- **Caching**: Spring Cache (Redis + Caffeine) via `config/CacheConfiguration` (e.g. batch history)

### Site Types & Schemas (019)
- **SiteType** (immutable per site): `DBF` (full CSV snapshots, server diffs) | `POSTGRES_CDC` (CSV baseline + JSONL deltas)
- **site_schemas** (JSONB, one per site): columns, types, `primaryKey`, `uniqueKeys`. Required before first batch for CDC sites.

### Business Rules
- One active batch per site (query check)
- Max 5 concurrent batches per account
- 60-minute batch timeout (scheduled task)
- Retention cleanup schedule is configurable by admins (cron via `/api/v1/admin/settings/batch-retention-schedule`)

## Code Style

### Java
- **Records**: Immutable DTOs and value objects
- **Lombok**: `@Getter`, `@NoArgsConstructor` for JPA entities
- **Explicit types**: Avoid `var`
- **Optionals**: Return from repos, avoid in parameters

### Naming
- Controllers: `{Domain}Controller` (client), `{Domain}AdminController` (admin)
- Services: `{Domain}Service` (application layer)
- Repositories: `{Entity}Repository` interface, `Jpa{Entity}Repository` impl
- DTOs: Java records with `fromEntity()` factory methods

### Testing
- **Unit**: Mock dependencies, `shouldDoSomethingWhenCondition()`
- **Integration**: Testcontainers (PostgreSQL + LocalStack)
- **Contract**: MockMvc endpoint verification

## Development Policy

_This file is the single source of dev rules (the spec-kit constitution is intentionally unused/empty). The policy below is **mandatory** and applies equally to humans and AI agents working in this repo._

### Rule 1 — Feature branches
- Every feature is developed on its own branch `feature/NNN-name`, **branched off `develop`**.
- A feature lands via a **Pull Request into `develop`**, merged with **squash** (one feature = one squashed commit on `develop`).
- A feature **must be documented** in `docs/` (a `docs/cr-*.md` change request and/or feature guide). Undocumented features are not merge-ready.

### Rule 2 — Test-first (TDD), task-by-task, serial
- A feature is split into ordered tasks in **`specs/NNN-name/tasks.md`** (use `/tasks`).
- Work tasks **strictly one at a time (WIP = 1)**. Do **not** start the next task until the current one is committed.
- For each task, follow **test-first**:
  1. **Study** the task and decide the approach/design before writing code.
  2. **Write the test set first** — it expresses the intended behavior and starts **red** (failing).
  3. **Implement**, iterating until **all tests are green**.
  4. **Tests track the decision, not frozen.** If you change the approach mid-task, **delete the obsolete tests and write new ones** — never keep tests that no longer reflect the chosen design.
  5. **Bar:** the task must be **adequately covered** by tests (its behavior, edge cases, and failure modes), and **100% green**.
  6. Commit **one atomic commit per task** (Conventional Commit referencing the task), e.g. `feat(batch): add retention scheduler (T03)`.
- **Gate — per-task tests must be 100% green** before committing (enforced by the pre-commit hook):
  - backend → `./gradlew test -PexcludeIntegration` (unit + contract; fast, no Docker)
  - frontend → `npx tsc --noEmit` (from `frontend/`) + `npm --prefix frontend run lint` + `npm --prefix frontend test`
- "100% green" = **all tests pass**, not 100% code coverage.

### Gates summary
| Gate | When | Must be green |
|---|---|---|
| **Per-task** (commit) | before every commit | `./gradlew test -PexcludeIntegration` (+ frontend `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint` and `vitest` if touched) |
| **Before PR** | before opening the PR | `./gradlew integrationTest` (Testcontainers) |
| **Merge** (PR → develop) | before merge | full CI (`backend-test`, `frontend-test`) green + automated review |

Merging to `develop` does **not** deploy. Dev (GKE) is deployed explicitly with a `deploy-dev/*` tag; stage/prod deploy on push to `stage`/`main` (see `docs/cr-tag-driven-dev-deploy.md`).

### Enforcement
- **git pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs the per-task gate and blocks red commits. Enable once per clone: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`. Bypassing (`--no-verify`) is against policy.
- **CI required checks**: the `backend-test` job (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`, runs `./gradlew test`) must be a **required status check** on PRs to `develop` (configure in GitHub branch protection).

### Conventions
- **Spec-driven**: each feature → `specs/NNN-name/` (spec → plan → tasks). Skills: `/specify`, `/plan`, `/tasks`, `/implement`, `/analyze`, `/clarify`. Larger design changes → `docs/cr-*.md`.
- **Conventional Commits**: `feat(scope):`, `fix(scope):`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `docs:`.
- **Migrations (Flyway)**: forward-only, sequential `V{N}__description.sql`; never edit an applied migration; backward-compatible defaults for new NOT NULL columns. Current at **V49**, next is **V50**.
- **API evolution (strangler)**: add a versioned surface alongside the old one, reusing the same application services; deprecate the old with a sunset, migrate clients, then remove it. Do **not** fork a separate service or duplicate the domain/persistence layer.

### «The current PR» — one resolution rule for every command

Whenever a command takes a PR number and none was given — `/merge`, `/code-review`, the `review`
skill, anything else — it means **the PR of the current session**, resolved in this order:

1. **From the branch you are on** — the normal case, since a session working an issue sits in its
   own worktree: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`, then
   `gh pr list --head <branch> --state open --json number,title`. Exactly one open PR → that is
   the target, no need to ask.
2. **On `develop`** (session working in the main tree, no branch of its own) → the PR this session
   actually worked on during the conversation. Name it and say where it came from.
3. **Still ambiguous** → do not guess. List the candidates and ask which one.
4. **Branch found but no open PR** → say so plainly: the work never reached a PR, there is nothing
   to review or merge.

Several open PRs on one branch is abnormal — show them and ask. And when *our* commands call
`/code-review` or `review`, they resolve the number first and pass it **explicitly**, so the
reviewer never has to guess.

### Working from a GitHub issue

Run `/github-issue <number>` (`.claude/commands/github-issue.md`). It drives the full lifecycle:

`Ready` (`status: ready`) → `In Progress` (`status: in progress`) + assignee + sprint milestone →
work in an **isolated tree** → TDD with the green per-task gate → docs in the same PR →
`./gradlew integrationTest` → PR into `develop` with `Closes #<n>` and `status: in review` → code
review loop until nothing is left open → merge `origin/develop` in, resolve conflicts, re-run the
gates → `status: ready to merge` → **stop and ask the human**. `/code-review ultra` is a deeper
cloud review only a human can launch.

"Isolated tree" is usually the Conductor workspace the session already sits in — that *is* a
worktree on its own branch off a freshly fetched `origin/develop`, so the command works in place
and does **not** nest a second worktree inside it. Nesting would hide the work from the diff
viewer, the Checks panel and `GetWorkspaceDiff`, which all show the *workspace branch*. Only
outside Conductor (a bare clone) does the command create `.worktrees/<n>-<slug>` on a branch
`<type>/<n>-<slug>` (`bug` → `fix/`, `enhancement` → `feature/`, else `chore/`; a spec-kit feature
keeps `feature/NNN-name`). The Conductor-generated branch name (`plissb/<workspace>`) is left
alone: PRs resolve by `--head <branch>`, and the issue number lives in the PR title and
`Closes #<n>`.

**Finding and fixing are separate for behaviour, and may be joined for mechanics.** A reviewer
offering `--fix` may be run with it, confined to the **mechanical** class — findings whose correct
edit is objective and settles nothing: formatting and line length, unused imports/locals, Java
naming **on private/local and new unpublished symbols only**, `var` → explicit type (Code Style
above), Javadoc on new public members, and `eslint --fix` within formatting-class rules (the
`--max-warnings 0` lint gate plus `tsc --noEmit` catch a bad one immediately).

Everything else is fixed by hand with a decision per finding. The carve-outs that matter here all
break a contract **the compiler and CI will not catch**: renaming a field/record component of a
DTO or JSONB model (Jackson binds by name), renaming a JPA entity field (the naming strategy maps
it to a column), anything in `src/main/proto/delta-ingestion.proto` (an already-shipped Windows
client is on the other end — see 035 and its taken field numbers), Micrometer metric names, cache
names, config keys and headers, SQL inside `@Query`, `@Transactional` semantics, an **applied**
Flyway migration, and on the frontend TanStack Query keys, route paths and Zod/API field names.
The test to apply to any future candidate: *can the edit break a contract in a way the compiler
and CI will not catch?* If yes, it is behavioural whatever style rule it cites. Where the line
runs is a human decision: an agent that thinks the mechanical class should move stops and says so.

**The review loop is visible in the PR.** The reviewer posts findings as a PR comment; after
fixing, post a reply comment answering every finding — fixed (sha + what changed), closed by the
reviewer's own `--fix` (`outcome: fixed` + sha), not fixed (reasoning + the issue filed for it),
or not applicable (why it was a false positive) — before the next round. `/code-review` is
single-shot per PR (it stops if it already reviewed that PR), so later rounds use the `review`
skill; silence is never "no findings". A fourth surface exists inside Conductor: the comments on
the workspace diff (`GetDiffComments`), which the human leaves in the Changes panel and which
exist before any PR — they block readiness like an unresolved thread, and `gh` cannot see them.
Findings *you* raise before the PR go to `DiffComment`, not GitHub. Review cleanliness is derived
from **all** review surfaces: `gh pr view --comments` omits inline `reviewThreads`, any thread with
`isResolved == false` blocks (even when `isOutdated`), a `PENDING` review visible to the acting
identity blocks, and a current `reviewDecision == CHANGES_REQUESTED` blocks. Closing an inline
finding is reply → ensure published → `resolveReviewThread`, with a state read after each
mutation. The ready-to-run GraphQL lives in `/github-issue` (step 8).

CI on a PR from a feature branch is `backend-test` + `frontend-test` only — `code-quality` and
`dependency-analysis` gate on `run_full_pipeline`, which is true for `develop`/`release`/`main`
alone, so their absence is not a failure. `./gradlew test -PexcludeIntegration` still needs Docker
(~30 contract tests use Testcontainers); without it the gate dies inside `Unsafe.java`. The
`SqlGenerationService` concurrency tests are known-flaky and fail on a clean tree too — re-run
before blaming your change, but never write off a red check without checking which one it is.

The merge into `develop` never happens without a human go-ahead. Normally that go-ahead is per PR,
via `/merge <pr>` (invoking it is the authorization). That command re-checks readiness, merges
with **squash** (one issue = one commit, as the whole current history), closes the issue, moves
the card to `Done` and strips the `status: *` labels. `deleteBranchOnMerge` is off in the repo
settings, so `--delete-branch` is passed explicitly. Cleanup removes only what the command
created: a nested worktree is removed, a **Conductor workspace is never touched** — the human
archives it (or the "Auto-archive on PR close" setting does).

**Docs ship with the code** (Rule 1). The living journal is **"Recent Changes" in this file** plus
`docs/` (`cr-*.md` and the client guides); root `CHANGELOG.md` is deliberately frozen and carries
an "out of date" banner — do not resurrect it on your own initiative. Say "needed" or "not needed"
for each documentation surface rather than skipping silently.

**Follow-ups are tickets, not notes — but search before filing.** Anything out of scope worth
doing later: first search **open and closed** issues (`gh issue list --state all --search …`) and
grep `CLAUDE.md`/`docs/`, because several workspaces work this repo in parallel. An open match
gets your evidence as a comment; a closed match means either a regression (new issue linking the
old one and the fixing commit) or a stale observation (the fix is already in `develop` — no ticket
needed). Only if nothing matched, file the issue (described, labelled, milestoned, `Backlog` on
the board) — and do not start work on it in the current cycle.

### Running several issues at once

`/github-issue-runner` (`.claude/commands/github-issue-runner.md`) is a **dispatcher**: it keeps
up to **three** issues in flight and picks up the next as a slot frees. Invoking it gives the
merge go-ahead **for that run** — the one exception to the per-PR gate above. Nothing else
relaxes: every readiness condition and every `/merge` check is still verified, merges stay
serialized one at a time, the dispatcher writes no code itself, and an executor's report is
re-verified against GitHub before anything is merged.

**No agent can create a Conductor workspace** (local ones open on a human's click; the `conductor`
CLI covers cloud workspaces only and needs its own API token), so the dispatcher runs in one of
two modes. **Mode A (default under Conductor)**: it plans the order, hands the human a ready list
— issue, workspace name, the `/github-issue <n>` to type — then watches GitHub and merges. The
work stays visible in the app and each task keeps a real session. **Mode B (`agents`, or outside
Conductor)**: background subagents in `.worktrees/<n>-<slug>`, fully autonomous but invisible in
the sidebar. In mode A the dispatcher cannot read another workspace's Changes panel, so the
executor must confirm its own panel is clear before its PR counts as ready.

The pool is the `Backlog` and `Ready` columns of project 16, any milestone. Order is **logical,
not chronological** — dependencies (contract, refactor, migration, infrastructure before their
consumers) and, separately, overlap in the code touched: two issues editing the same product files
never run in parallel. Three overlaps here are invisible to git and must be sequenced by hand: the
next **Flyway migration number** (two branches both taking `V{N}` merge cleanly and break startup),
**field numbers in `delta-ingestion.proto`**, and `specs/NNN-*` directory numbers. Accumulating
files (`CLAUDE.md`, `specs/**/tasks.md`, `docs/`) are not overlap — both sides get merged.

The run stops for the human on an agent reporting blocked, a second dispatcher touching an issue
in this run's window, an unclear conflict, red CI on `develop`, a missing `project` scope, an issue
that turned out wider than written, or the same issue coming back blocked twice. Findings mid-run
become issues for a later run, never additions to the current window. The run scripts are
`nonconcurrent` (one shared docker-compose stack and a fixed 8080), so only one workspace can hold
the live stand at a time — sequence the tasks that need it.

#### Board identifiers — the single source, do not copy them elsewhere

Project **16** `Data Forge Middleware — Sprints`, owner `quantum-soft-dev`.
Project id `PVT_kwDOB7LEnM4BeGrE`, `Status` field id `PVTSSF_lADOB7LEnM4BeGrEzhYjWtc`.

| Column | option-id |
|---|---|
| Backlog | `f75ad846` |
| Ready | `8a89f088` |
| In Progress | `47fc9ee4` |
| Blocked | `3a5c4fbe` |
| In Review | `a34edc01` |
| Done | `98236657` |

```bash
gh project item-list 16 --owner quantum-soft-dev --format json --limit 100   # find by content.number
gh project item-add  16 --owner quantum-soft-dev --url <issue-url>           # if not on the board
gh project item-edit --project-id <project-id> --id <PVTI_...> \
    --field-id <status-field-id> --single-select-option-id <option-id>
```

If `item-edit` fails, never invent ids — re-read them with
`gh project field-list 16 --owner quantum-soft-dev --format json`; the board may have changed.
`/github-issue`, `/github-issue-runner` and `/merge` all read these ids from here, so they stay in
one place: a copy in each command would drift silently and start moving cards into a column that
no longer exists.

**Status lives in two places and both must be moved on every transition:** the Kanban board
(Projects v2 `Status`, project **16**) and the repo `status: *` labels. The ticket walks the
columns in order — jumping is not allowed:

`Backlog` → `Ready` (`status: ready`) → `In Progress` (`status: in progress`) → `In Review`
(`status: in review`, then `status: ready to merge` while awaiting the human) → `Done`.
`Blocked` (`status: blocked`) is the side exit at any point.

Moving the board needs the `project` token scope — if `gh project` fails with
`INSUFFICIENT_SCOPES`, run `gh auth refresh -s project` and say so instead of silently updating
only the label. Always re-read the board after a transition: a command that exited 0 is not proof
the state moved.

> `.specify/memory/constitution.md` is an **unfilled spec-kit template** (`[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`
> placeholders) and is intentionally unused. This file is the normative source for the process;
> do not cite the constitution as if it contained rules.

### Conductor workspaces

`.conductor/settings.toml` (shared, read from `develop` on the remote — it only takes effect once
merged) gives every new workspace `npm --prefix frontend ci` + `core.hooksPath`, run scripts for
the compose stack / backend / Vite (`--port $CONDUCTOR_PORT`, since `vite.config.ts` pins 3000)
and the per-task test gate, `run_mode = "nonconcurrent"` (one shared stack, fixed 8080/5432/6379/
4566), and `archive = "git worktree prune"` so a nested worktree does not outlive its workspace —
deliberately not `docker compose down`, which would kill a stack another workspace is using.
`.worktreeinclude` copies the gitignored `frontend/.env.local` and `local-dev/auth0.env` into each
new workspace; listing that file at all **replaces** Conductor's default `.env*` pattern, so
anything else needed must be added there too. If `frontend/node_modules` is missing in a fresh
workspace, the setup script did not run: run it by hand and say so rather than skipping the
frontend gate.

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Auth0 Integration
- **Account creation**: Auth0-first with compensating transaction (delete Auth0 user if DB fails)
- **Custom claims**: `https://api.dataforge.com/roles`, `https://api.dataforge.com/accountId`
- **M2M token caching**: 24h TTL with 1h buffer, thread-safe refresh

### Error Handling
```
400 - IllegalArgumentException, validation errors
403 - AccessDeniedException, wrong token type
404 - NoHandlerFoundException
500 - Generic exceptions
```

### Plugin System
- **Plugin interface**: `Plugin.getId()`, `validateConfig()`, `onActivate()`, `onDeactivate()`
- **BitBiPlugin**: SQL generation from CSV uploads, API key auth
- **API key**: Generated on activation, BCrypt hashed, returned once only
- **Audit logs**: All plugin actions logged to partitioned table with JSONB metadata

#### Plugin Action Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ACTIVATE` | Plugin activated for account |
| `DEACTIVATE` | Plugin deactivated |
| `SQL_GENERATION_STARTED` | SQL generation began for batch |
| `SQL_GENERATION_COMPLETED` | SQL generation finished (includes stats: insertCount, updateCount, deleteCount) |
| `SQL_GENERATION_FAILED` | SQL generation error (includes errorMessage) |

#### User-Facing Plugin Logs
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/account/plugins/{pluginId}/logs`
- **Filters**: `siteId`, `from`, `to` (ISO 8601), `page`, `size` (max 100)
- **Frontend**: Logs tab in My Plugins widget (Dashboard) with site filter, date range, page size selector
- **Data**: Action type, success/failure status, error messages, SQL generation statistics, siteId, siteDomain
- **Security**: Excludes sensitive data (IP, user agent, client IDs)

#### User-Facing Batch SQL Status
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/v1/account/plugins/{pluginId}/batches`
- **Filters**: `siteId`, `page`, `size` (max 100)
- **Frontend**: SQL tab in My Plugins widget (Dashboard) with site filter, page size selector
- **Data**: Batch info, site domain, SQL generation status (isBaseline, hasSql, generationId)

### Bit BI Plugin API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/plugins/bit-bi/sites` | GET | List sites for account |
| `/api/v1/plugins/bit-bi/sites/{siteId}/files` | GET | List CSV files for site (for initialization) |
| `/api/v1/plugins/bit-bi/sites/{siteId}/files/{fileName}` | GET | Download CSV file (proxy from S3) |
| `/api/v1/plugins/bit-bi/sql-changes` | GET | Get SQL changes (params: siteId, since) |
| `/api/v1/account/plugins/{pluginId}/logs` | GET | Plugin activity logs (user-facing) |
| `/api/v1/account/plugins/bit-bi/rotate-api-key` | POST | Rotate the API key (owner OAuth2; new key shown once) |

### Bit BI Plugin Initialization Flow
1. **Activation/Reinit**: `baseline_batch_id` is set to the latest completed batch
2. **Baseline batch**: Client downloads CSV files via `/sites/{siteId}/files` endpoint (no SQL generated)
3. **Subsequent batches**: SQL deltas generated (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE compared to previous batch)
4. **First batch after activation (no history)**: Becomes the baseline batch automatically

### Global Error Handling (016)
- **Device API**: `POST /api/v1/device/errors` with optional `severity` field (CRITICAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO)
- **User API**: Auth0 OAuth2 with accountId claim
- **ErrorLog**: severity (enum), isRead (boolean) fields added
- **Dashboard**: GlobalErrorsWidget with unread badge (30s polling)

#### Global Error API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/account/errors` | GET | List global errors (params: page, size, unreadOnly) |
| `/api/v1/account/errors/unread-count` | GET | Get unread error count for badge |
| `/api/v1/account/errors/{errorId}` | GET | Get global error details |
| `/api/v1/account/errors/{errorId}/read` | PATCH | Mark single error as read |
| `/api/v1/account/errors/mark-as-read` | POST | Mark multiple errors as read (body: errorIds[]) |
| `/api/v1/account/errors/mark-all-as-read` | POST | Mark all errors as read |

### S3 File Storage
- **Path**: `{accountId}/{domain}/{date}/{time}/{filename}`
- **Plugins**: `plugins/{pluginId}/{accountId}/{siteName}/{datetime}.sql`
- **Retry**: 3 attempts, fixed 1s delay
- **Presigned URLs**: 15-minute expiry for downloads

### Frontend (Feature-Sliced Design)
```
features/{feature}/api/     # API client, queries, mutations
features/{feature}/model/   # Types
features/{feature}/ui/      # Components
widgets/{feature}/          # Container components
pages/{feature}/            # Route pages
```

## Known Limitations

1. Test coverage ~16% (legacy code untested). Note: a jacoco 80% verification task is declared but **not wired into the build gate**.
2. Rate limiting only on the Plugin API (per-account, Bucket4j); no global rate limiting yet
3. S3 single region only
4. In-memory batch counting (not atomic across instances)
5. Basic retry logic (no exponential backoff)

## Recent Changes
- 036-unified-batch-parquet: A completed Delta session exposes exactly one Parquet per table instead of a segment slice — `GET .../delta/batches/{batchId}/tables/{table}/parquet` (owner, issue #93) resolves a durable `batch_parquet_artifacts` manifest row (V49) and never guesses among the realtime per-segment egress objects, which are unchanged for existing consumers. Batch completion enqueues one row per table inside its own transaction; a bounded worker claims a row (the claim commits **before** the build, so a process that dies mid-build still spends an attempt), replays the batch's non-provisional segments into `egress/{siteId}/batches/{batchId}/{table}.parquet` with a file-backed streaming writer, and publishes `READY` only after `PutObject` returns. `claim_token` + a lease renewed during the build keep two workers off one artifact; failures back off by doubling up to `max-attempts` (7 ≈ 1 h) and then become `ABANDONED`. Download answers `409` while an attempt is queued/running/pending retry and `404` only when absent or abandoned; a batch that predates the feature is backfilled on the first click. Retention, admin batch delete and site wipe remove the rows and derive the object keys from `(site, batch, table)`. Config `DELTA_BATCH_PARQUET_*`; meters `delta.batch-parquet.{artifacts,duration,reclaims}`. See `docs/cr-unified-batch-parquet.md`, `docs/delta-client-v2-guide.md`, `specs/036-unified-batch-parquet/`.
- 035-site-history-wipe: A site can be given a true clean slate — `POST .../delta/wipe` (owner + admin, issue #89) destroys batches, uploaded files, changelog segments, checkpoints, the site schema, plugin SQL and error logs, and keeps the site. V48 adds `site_sync_state.generation` (an epoch bumped by a wipe and by nothing else — an ordinary re-baseline never moves it) plus `wipe_pending`, and `admin_action_logs.details`. The epoch travels on the wire as **`optional`** (explicit presence): `SyncStateResponse.generation`/`SessionOpened.generation` (field 5), `SessionStart.generation` (field **6**) and `ErrorCode.GENERATION_MISMATCH` (**12**) — 5 and 7 are taken in the shipped client's proto, so `SessionStart` field 5 stays `reserved`. The guard keys on presence, not on a zero: absent = old client, present-and-different (0 vs 1 included, i.e. a site's first wipe) = refused. `ErrorCode` 7–11 are no longer reserved — the server declares and emits the client's `OVERFLOW`/`OVERFLOW_BYTES`/`SITE_INACTIVE`/`SCHEMA_REQUIRED`/`CONCURRENT_BATCH_LIMIT` (dbf-data-extractor#130). Bit BI re-captures its baselines automatically on the first post-wipe checkpoint (`DELTA_AUTO_REINIT`). See `docs/delta-v2-wire-contract-answers.md`, `docs/site-history-wipe-client-guide.md`, `docs/delta-client-v2-guide.md`, `specs/035-site-history-wipe/`.
- 034-delta-rebaseline-cancellation: A requested full re-baseline can be taken back — `DELETE .../delta/rebaseline` (owner + admin, issue #84). V47 records `batches.session_mode` and `site_sync_state.rebaseline_notified_at`, the two facts that make the outcome answerable: `cancelled` / `snapshot-in-progress` (a live FULL_SNAPSHOT is reported and left alone, so a drop before its commit still re-arms the retry) / `client-notified` / `not-requested`. A running snapshot also surfaces as `snapshotInProgress` on the sync-state projection. See `docs/delta-client-v2-guide.md` ("Cancelling a re-baseline").
- 033-delta-rebaseline-segmented: A re-baseline is sealed into bounded segments instead of buffering the whole snapshot, so a site above `delta.ingestion.max-session-records` is no longer bricked by the "Full re-baseline" button (issue #82). Seals are silent on the wire (`SessionCommitted` stays terminal for periodic sessions) and the segments are `provisional` (V46) — invisible to the checkpoint fold, the egress queue and the Bit BI SQL queue — until `SessionEnd` discards the old baseline and publishes them in one transaction. No proto or client change. See `docs/cr-delta-rebaseline-segmented.md`, `specs/033-delta-rebaseline-segmented/`.
- 032-remove-client-api-v1: Retired `/api/dfc/**`, credential-based token issuance, V1-only branches, and HTTP multipart ingestion. V45 migrates stored sites to V2 and temporarily normalizes V1 writes from old pods during a rolling deployment. Historical uploaded CSV files remain readable through the Bit BI files API fallback.
- tag-driven-dev-deploy: merges to `develop` run tests only — dev (GKE) deploys **only** via `deploy-dev/*` tags (`TAG=deploy-dev/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M); git tag $TAG && git push origin $TAG`); stage/prod still deploy on push to `stage`/`main`; ghcr docker jobs in ci-cd.yml dormant (`if: false`, AWS rollback only). See `docs/cr-tag-driven-dev-deploy.md`.
- 029-batch-per-session: Batch = one Delta v2 ingestion session (see `docs/cr-batch-per-session.md`, `specs/029-batch-per-session/`). Continuous seals commit segments under the session's single batch (many segments : 1 batch; per-segment S3 keys `segments/{segmentId}.pb.gz`); no per-seal batch cycling, no empty tail batches; `BATCH_COMPLETED` once per session; Upload History list aggregates SUM(records)/DISTINCT tables SQL-side (`aggregateByBatchIds`); batch timeout for streaming batches counts from `batches.last_activity_at` (V41, touched at start/ack/seal) — the V2 sweeper exclusion is removed.
- 028-parquet-export-plugin: Parquet Export plugin (see `docs/parquet-export-plugin-guide.md`, `specs/028-parquet-export-plugin/`). Second Plugin SPI impl `parquet-export`: Basic Auth credentials minted at activation (login plaintext + BCrypt hash in plugin_data, shown once as `login:password`; rotation via `POST /api/v1/account/plugins/parquet-export/rotate-password`); `GET /api/v1/plugins/parquet-export/files` (Basic Auth, filters since/siteId/table/type=delta|checkpoint, per-account rate limit) registers one-time download links (`download_links`, V39; V40 unique login index); anonymous `GET /download/{token}` consumes atomically → 302 to ~60s presigned URL, then 410; purge scheduler; dedicated security filter chain (Order 4). Config `plugin.parquet-export.*`.
- 022-delta-client-v2: Delta Client v2 gRPC ingestion (see `docs/cr-delta-client-v2.md`, `docs/delta-client-v2-guide.md`, `specs/022-delta-client-v2/`). gRPC server on :9090 (`DeltaIngestionService`) — SessionStart/StreamChanges/SessionEnd/GetSyncState/SubmitSchema; the `delta/` aggregate (SiteSyncState, ChangelogSegment, Checkpoint), changelog fold + CSV/Parquet checkpoints, event-driven per-segment delta Parquet egress. Migrations V29–V36. Sites default to `client_api_version = V2`.
- 025-delta-parquet-download: Per-batch delta Parquet download endpoints + UI pills (`DeltaSegmentParquetQueryService`, owner route `/api/v1/account/sites/{siteId}/delta/batches/{batchId}/tables/{table}/parquet`), documented in `docs/delta-client-v2-guide.md` ("Delta Parquet in the UI").
- 024-visual-language-migration: Entire frontend unified on the monitoring visual language (see `docs/cr-visual-language-migration.md`, `specs/024-visual-language-migration/`). Single token source `shared/ui/tokens.ts` (+ remapped shadcn CSS vars: `--primary` #3C82D8, `--radius` 10px; Tailwind semantic utilities `ink.*`/`brand.*`/`surface.*`/`hairline`/`separator`/`danger.*`/`warn.*`/`shadow-panel`). All `shared/ui/ui/*` primitives restyled (Badge = alpha pills `info|neutral|success|warning|critical|stalled` + `dot`; Button incl. `destructive-outline`/`compact`; hairline Table without uppercase headers; site-detail Tabs treatment as default; new `shared/ui/page-header.tsx`). Old language mechanically absent (grep audits in `specs/024-…/quickstart.md` = 0 hits). Visual-only: no API/behavior changes; P2 (owner lite segments) and `.dark` block untouched.
- 023-delta-sync-ui: UI layer over Delta v2 (see `docs/delta-client-v2-guide.md` "Delta Sync UI", `specs/022-delta-client-v2/ui-redesign-tasks.md`). Backend: REST `/api/v1/account/sites/{siteId}/delta/**` (owner) + `/api/v1/sites/{siteId}/delta/**` (admin) — sync-state, checkpoints + per-click presigned downloads, segments (admin), rebuild/rebaseline triggers, bulk site health; persistent rebaseline/rebuild flags (V35); full checkpoint Parquet reinstated (V36, reverts V34). Frontend: site-detail shell (`/account/sites/$siteId`, `/admin/sites/$siteId`) with Upload history + Delta Sync tabs, `widgets/delta-sync/DeltaSyncWidget` (lag track, activity sparkline/throughput, checkpoints Table|Cards, rebuild/re-baseline AlertDialogs), delta Batch Detail redesign, site-list sync-health pill, `features/delta-sync` (Zod DTOs, severity model, monitoring tokens). Pending product decisions: P1 Geist font (F13 skipped), P2 owner lite segments (segments/throughput admin-only).
- 021-unified-upload-api: Unified upload API consolidation across client API versions
- 020-sql-generation-optimization: Concurrency control (semaphore max 2), merge-join CSV diff algorithm (~6x→~1x memory), streaming S3 parsing, memory backpressure (heap threshold), thread pool reduction (10/20→4/8), eager GC. Config: `plugin.sql-generation.max-concurrent`, `heap-threshold-percent`, `semaphore-timeout-seconds`
- 019-site-types-postgres-cdc: SiteType (DBF/POSTGRES_CDC), site_schemas (JSONB), JSONL delta uploads, PK-aware SQL generation strategy. Auth V2: device flow + refresh tokens, site_name. See `docs/cr-site-types-postgres-cdc.md`, `docs/postgres-cdc-client-guide.md`

- 017-csv-file-initialization: Added baseline_batch_id to account_plugins, new /sites/{siteId}/files endpoints for CSV download, SQL generation skipped for baseline batch
- 016-global-error-handling: Added severity and isRead to ErrorLog, GlobalErrorUserController with user-facing endpoints, frontend GlobalErrorsWidget on Dashboard
